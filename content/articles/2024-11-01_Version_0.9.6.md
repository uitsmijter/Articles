## Uitsmijter 0.9.6 Release: New Features, Improvements, and Fixes

We‚Äôre excited to announce Uitsmijter version 0.9.6, packed with feature additions, enhancements, fixes, and important 
updates. With this release, we‚Äôre pushing Uitsmijter forward with improved performance, better tooling, and 
compatibility enhancements. 

We've made a significant step forward on the [roadmap](https://discourse.uitsmijter.io/t/uitsmijter-roadmap-0-9-6/20), 
streamlining and enhancing the developer experience with several key updates, new features, and some fixes.

This release introduces Docker-only support, ensuring a consistent and reliable deployment environment, along with 
advanced Kubernetes namespace management capabilities to better handle scoped tenants and clients. Developers will also 
benefit from new tooling commands, making it easier to launch Visual Studio Code in a browser within Docker and to 
quickly clean up resources and maintain an optimized workspace.

Additionally, this update brings important changes to improve performance and compatibility across various components, 
from more efficient HTTP handling to updated namings. Core frameworks like Vapor and Swift have been upgraded, keeping 
Uitsmijter compatible with current technologies and best practices. 

With a host of improvements, Uitsmijter 0.9.6 is designed to offer a smoother, more efficient, and developer-friendly 
experience on the way to a official version 1.0, that will be ü•Åfully Swift 6 compatible. 

### Here's what‚Äôs new:

**Feature Additions**
- **Namespace Scoped Tenants and Clients**: Uitsmijter now supports local namespace-scoped tenants and clients, making it easier to define boundaries and permissions specific for various projects working on one cluster.
- **New Tooling Commands**: Two new commands have been added to streamline workflows:
    - **`code`**: Launches Visual Studio Code in a Dockerized environment directly within your browser, allowing seamless code editing without setup. [Making it easier for new developers to get started with open source projects](./2024-03-06_code).
    - **`remove`**: Efficiently cleans up your Docker environment by removing all Docker resources and clearing the build folder.

**Support for Docker-only installations**  
Starting with version 0.9.6, Uitsmijter will run seamlessly in a Docker only environment, too, while ensuring the same 
functionallity consistent with the kubernetes installation. 
This finally simplifies setups, reduces dependency conflicts, and makes Uitsmijter easier to use for smaller systems.

**Key Changes**
- **Scripting Provider‚Äôs Fetch Method**: The `fetch` method now leverages `AsyncHTTPClient` rather than `FoundationNetwork`'s `URLSession`, providing a more efficient and reliable way to handle HTTP requests.
- **Redis Database Naming**: Redis instances are now clearly identified with `uitsmijter-session-master` and `uitsmijter-session-slave`, helping to avoid confusion and enhancing configuration clarity.
- **End-to-End Testing in `--fast` Mode**: End-to-end tests running in `--fast` mode will now default to using Chromium, ensuring consistent behavior and results across tests.
- **Default Login Page Image Support**: To streamline compatibility, we‚Äôve removed `webp` support for the Uitsmijter default login page.

**Improvements**
- **Renaming Littleletetr to Ham**: To better align documentation and reduce ambiguity, ‚ÄúLittleletetr‚Äù has been renamed to ‚ÄúHam‚Äù across all relevant documentation and testing szenarios.
- **Dedicated Build Folder for `code` Command**: The `code` tooling command now utilizes its own build folder, streamlining the workspace and reducing cross-dependencies.
- **Filtered Testing Capability**: The `test` command now supports an optional filter, allowing you to selectively run tests and focus on specific areas of the codebase.

**Fixes**
- **Encoding Format Adjustment**: The encoding date format has been switched from `.iso8601` to `.deferredToDate`, aligning with updated standards for date handling.
- **Enhanced Error Handling for Non-existent Pages**: The error message for missing pages has been updated to `NOT_FOUND` (replacing the prior `ERRORS.NO_TENANT`), creating a clearer and more consistent user experience.
- **Log Message Origins**: Log entries now display the correct origin, improving traceability and making debugging easier.

**Framework and Build Updates**
- **Vapor Update**: We‚Äôve upgraded to Vapor 4.106.1, ensuring Uitsmijter benefits from the latest framework improvements and optimizations.
- **Buildbox 2.3.0**: Our build environment now runs on Buildbox 2.3.0, enhancing build stability and efficiency.
- **Swift 5.9.2 Compatibility**: Uitsmijter is now fully compatible with Swift 5.9.2, bringing improved language features and stability.

This release reflects our commitment to providing powerful, reliable, and efficient tools to support the development process. 
Thank you for being part of the Uitsmijter community! Enjoy version 0.9.6 and happy login!
