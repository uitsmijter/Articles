## Navigating Digital Transformation: Overcoming Legacy Challenges for SMEs
In an era of rapid technological evolution, digitisation has become the cornerstone of progress, albeit at varying paces 
across different regions. Germany for example, often viewed as an economic powerhouse, is navigating the digital landscape 
at a measured slow pace. The challenges faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the wake of the second wave 
of digitisation are particularly notable. We explores the imperative need for flexible authorisation systems and the 
hurdles posed by legacy applications in the ongoing digitization journey of SMEs.

### The Legacy Conundrum
The inertia in digitisation isn't just a matter of transitioning from analogue to digital; it extends to the intricate 
process of upgrading existing digital applications. Legacy applications, often deeply embedded in the project landscape, 
wield significant influence, holding a repository of intellectual knowledge about a company. Modernisation becomes a 
necessity, requiring the extraction of authentication data from these legacy systems and their integration into external 
services through Single Sign-On (SSO).

### The Challenge of Dependency
Untangling the intricate web of dependencies within applications is a formidable challenge. The dependency tree, a 
complex network rooted in legacy systems, hinders real progress. The reluctance to engage in complete reprogramming, 
while challenging, is essential to safeguard intellectual property and meet the demands of digitisation. Successful 
modernisation hinges on gradual, process-anchored changes, as opposed to drastic overhauls.

### Customising Solutions for SMEs
Existing market solutions, while addressing technical standards, fall short in driving economic digitisation for SMEs. 
They often position themselves as core software, requiring companies to adapt their products. True progress lies in 
tailoring solutions to the specific needs of companies, aligning with their processes and structures. A process-oriented 
approach, rooted in the companies' requirements, is paramount for effective digitisation.

### Standardisation and Sovereignty
Standardisation plays a pivotal role in promoting interoperability and maintaining quality standards. However, the lack 
of procedural guidance and reference implementations leaves small and medium-sized companies grappling with choices that 
might not seamlessly integrate into their processes. Cloud-based authentication solutions offered by Software as a 
Service (SaaS) providers, though adhering to standards, introduce dependencies that compromise sovereignty over processes 
in the long term.

### Empowering Digitisation
To facilitate the digital transition, companies need accessible guides and reference points. A repository of freely 
accessible process descriptions, templates, and software can serve as a beacon for secure and cost-effective implementation. 
The focus should be on harvesting the low-hanging fruit, addressing immediate needs, and collectively strategising 
process improvements through shared data, experiences, and procedures.

### Domain Driven Design, Microservices, and Data-Mesh
In the intricate tapestry of digitisation, Domain Driven Design/Development (DDD), Microservices, and Data-Mesh emerge 
as critical frameworks for SMEs seeking to navigate the evolving digital landscape. Domain Driven Development offers a 
strategic approach, emphasising collaboration between technical and domain experts, ensuring that software aligns 
seamlessly with the unique needs of the business. As a successor to theoretical DDD-Paradigma, Microservices decentralise 
applications into modular, independently deployable services, fostering agility and scalability. Complementing this 
paradigm, Data-Mesh advocates for a decentralised approach to data architecture, aligning data domains with organisational 
boundaries.

Together, these methodologies provide a cohesive framework for companies looking to modernise legacy systems without 
disrupting the entire ecosystem. They enable gradual, iterative changes that resonate with the ongoing digitalisation 
journey of SMEs, ensuring adaptability and responsiveness to evolving business demands.

### Conclusion
As Europe navigates the digital terrain, the imperative for SMEs to overcome legacy challenges becomes evident. 
Flexibility, process-oriented approaches, and a nuanced understanding of the standardisation landscape are critical. 
By fostering a collaborative spirit, sharing resources, and prioritising accessible tools, SMEs can not only adapt to 
the evolving digital landscape but also thrive in it. The journey may be gradual, but the destination is a future where 
digitisation aligns seamlessly with economic success.
