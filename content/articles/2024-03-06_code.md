Open source projects are like a vast field that offers developers a wealth of 
opportunities to get involved and work together on exciting projects. Beyond the purely 
social aspect, participation in such projects offers a wide range of benefits. Not only 
can developers acquire new skills and contribute to the community, but they can also 
customize the software and optimize it to their own needs.

Helping to shape the code according to one's own ideas is an incentive for many, 
especially when it comes to use within a company. By adding new features, fixing bugs 
and optimizing performance, the software can be customized to meet the exact requirements 
needed without having to reinvent everything. This flexibility gives developers the 
opportunity to implement creative ideas and design the software in a unique way. It 
becomes easier to realize your own project ideas.

Participation in open source projects offers a holistic experience that not only
drives technical development, but also promotes exchange and collaboration within the 
developer community. The developers involved have a larger toolbox from which they can 
choose. This broad knowledge is in demand in many companies.

## The challenge
However, potential contributors often face challenges that prevent them from actively 
participating in the first place and building the fundamental knowledge needed to make 
code changes.

The time it takes a new developer to get to grips with setting up a project before they 
can make a small code change can vary greatly and depends on various factors. These 
include the complexity of the project, familiarity with the technologies and tools used, 
the quality of the [existing documentation](https://docs.uitsmijter.io) and the 
[support](https://discourse.uitsmijter.io) provided by the maintainers. 

This hurdle becomes even more significant when you consider that many enthusiastic 
developers first gain an overview of various projects in order to acquire basic 
knowledge. Only when it comes to a specific application they refer back to the 
respective project and actively participate in the development and maintenance.

At [Uitsmijter](https://uitsmijter.io), we have recognized that these hurdles are 
generally too high and have made it our mission to inspire developers with our 
technology and our onboarding process.

## Solution approaches
Projects should make setting up the development environment as easy as possible by 
providing automated scripts or configuration files. This can help new developers get 
started coding quickly without wasting time on configuration. For more complex projects, 
this goes beyond a simple compiler build.

It's important to make the setup process fun to help new developers take the first leap 
and keep them motivated. Good documentation, clear instructions and support from the 
community will certainly help minimize the time a new developer needs to set up.

To achieve this, we at Uitsmijter have put a lot of effort into the development of our 
[toolchain](https://docs.uitsmijter.io/contribution/tooling/). This should support 
developers in the best possible way and at the same time have a certain simplicity so 
that developers understand it and also like to maintain it.

## The evolution of the toolchain
Uitsmijter provides a set of tools that enable every developer to have a consistent 
and reproducible user experience. Since version 0.8.1, Uitsmijter has been built 
and tested on both macOS and Linux in a 
[Docker environment provided](https://github.com/uitsmijter/Buildbox) for this purpose. 
In the second phase of tooling development, two new important commands followed in 
version 0.9.2: `./tooling.sh run-cluster` and `./tooling.sh e2e`.

The continuous improvement and refinement of the toolchain has resulted in the Uitsmijter 
project having a provided set of 
[well formulated and maintainable bash scripts](https://github.com/uitsmijter/Uitsmijter/tree/main/Deployment/tooling/includes) 
that can check, build, test, end-to-end test, package and bootstrap the project for 
local testing in the same way within provided containers on Mac and Linux.

## Innovations
As soon as we release version 0.9.6 we will bring further progress to our toolchain: the 
unified developer environment (*UDE*). This can, but does not have to be used. Our aim is 
to ensure that even internal employees are happy to switch over and prefer to use the 
new tools rather than the usual IDE of their choice (Eat your own dog food). 

Version 0.9.6 adds another tooling module: `./tooling.sh code`. 
[This command](https://docs.uitsmijter.io/contribution/tooling/#code) opens a 
[Docker container](https://github.com/uitsmijter/swift-codeserver) on the local device, 
which starts an online version of Visual Studio Code (based on 
[coder/code](https://github.com/coder/code-server)) that is adapted for operation in 
the browser. Thanks to the work of [Adam Fowler](https://github.com/adam-fowler) and the
[Visual Studio Code Extension for Swift](https://github.com/swift-server/vscode-swift).
All unit tests can be executed and breakpoints can be set. The "Start" button 
runs the project as a standalone within the container.

This function can now be tested on the [main branch](https://github.com/uitsmijter/Uitsmijter) of 
Uitsmijter.

Check it out: 
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/uitsmijter/Uitsmijter.git
$ cd Uitsmijter
$ ./tooling.sh code
```
_The first download of the Docker-Image takes a while..._

After the image is downloaded your default browser will open the IDE automatically.

## Conclusion
Facilitating onboarding for new developers in open source projects is crucial to 
encourage diversity of contributions and strengthen the community. Through clear 
structuring, comprehensive documentation and a supportive onboarding process, projects 
can overcome challenges and provide new developers with a positive experience that 
encourages them to actively participate in the project. The IDE integrated into the 
tooling makes this process a little bit easier, so that a commit can take place with 
minimal time.
